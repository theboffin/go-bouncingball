Bouncing Ball demo in GO

One of my favourite things to write in any new language I come across is bouncing a ball around the screen.

Please note with this repo, I am EXTREMELY NEW to GO.  While this demo does work, and seems to work well, it's written by a GO novice, and as and when my GO skills improve i'll refactor this.

This is a console mode application.  For controlling console i/o I use https://github.com/rivo/tview/wiki 

The bouncing of the ball should auto-correct itself for any change in terminal window size
